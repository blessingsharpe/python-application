#External NAT Gateway IPs
#By default this module will provision new Elastic IPs for the VPC's NAT Gateways. This means that when creating a new VPC, new IPs are allocated, and when that VPC is destroyed those IPs are released
#Sometimes it is handy to keep the same IPs even after the VPC is destroyed and re-created. To that end, it is possible to assign existing IPs to the NAT Gateways. This prevents the destruction of the VPC from releasing those IPs, while making it possible that a re-created VPC uses the same IPs.



##To achieve this, allocate the IPs outside the VPC module declaration. I'm using two public subnets for this hence the count=2

resource "aws_eip" "nat" {
  count = 2

  vpc = true
}


#Then, pass the allocated IPs as a parameter to this module.

  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
